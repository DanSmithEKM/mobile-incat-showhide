# mobile-incat-showhide
Some simple code to add in Show/Hide functionality for category descriptions on EKM Mobile Shops
# Use Case and Dependencies
While the code here and can be used for other purposes, it's intented use case is on the Mobile Shop on the EKM Shop platform. The default paths are specific to the EKM platform and the are jQuery dependencies in this code that rely on jQuery 3.2.0 or higher that are not referenced directly as this is already present on EKM. 
# Installation and Configuration
The CSS and JS files are ready to use 'as is' and should be uploaded to the 'Stylesheets' and 'Other' sections of the File Manager respectively. This can be found in the 'Design' tab of the EKM platform. The CSS styling can be edited using a web-based editor following import if necessary. The HTML file contains 'head' and 'body' tags demonstratively, however the code contained should be copied into the existing tags within the theme. The 'body' text should replace the default 'incategory-description' class entirely.
